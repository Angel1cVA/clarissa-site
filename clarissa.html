			<h2>September 2023</h2>
			<h3>The Month We Met</h3>
			<p>I came to a game night at Tori's dorm on September 22, 2023. She had given me the "who's who" via text the night before so I already had a good idea as to who I might like and who I wouldn't. Sure enough, my favorite people from the get go were Clarissa and Caleb, though Clarissa's quiet shyness and sense of humor quickly made her the overall favorite. I can distinctly remember her jokingly defending me that night when Tori said my ass was warm, and the next day when Tori added me to the game night group chat, Clarissa was the first and only person I added on Snapchat</p>

			<h2>October 2023</h2>
			<h3>Where it Began</h3>
			<p>After much discussion of Stardew Valley, I distributed a mod pack to Clarissa on October 1, 2023. She had expressed interest in lightly modding the game and luckily, I had mods on hand. A couple days later on October 3, 2023, we started Cozy Farm together with our trusty cat Warm Ass. The first time we played, we were on call for around four hours and decided to play weekly.</p>

			<h2>November 2023</h2>
			<h3>An Unexpected Journey</h3>
			<p>Following a rather enjoyable Stardew session on November 3, 2023, we decided to stop playing and just send memes and shitpost videos to each other for about three hours (after a 2 hour long Stardew session) and that is where the spark was lit. The calls became longer from then on, both of us silently not wanting to stop talking to one another without being super obvious about it.</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>Fast forward two weeks. November 17, 2023. Game night at Kent, a long dish shift at Canfield. Clarissa, being a little drunk, was talking to me more frequently than normal (at least for when I was at work) and I was in my head a lot during the shift. I made a private story post that read "Idk if she gave me a boquet in Stardew I'd prolly say yes" and didn't realise I had put her in the story. She, of course, immediately slid up and corrected my spelling. We kinda danced around the topic for the rest of the night, between direct DMs and more private story posts.</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>The following day she asked if I meant what I said the previous day. I, of course, said yes, and we began talking about a potential first date. We settled on the date, being November 28, 2023 and the location, Buffalo Wild Wings Kent. Armed with nothing but my wallet, my keys, and lots of careful perparation (my mom and sister wouldn't let me leave the house until I "looked presentable"), I made my way to Kent. It went better than either of us could have even imagined, adding a trip to Off the Wagon to the itnerary. I soon worked up the courage to ask her out, and luckily she said yes.</p>

			<h2>December 2023</h2>
			<p>With more Stardew in the future, soon enough Clarissa's birthday was on the horizon. Even though she asked me <strong><i>SEVERAL</i></strong> times to not spend money on her, I got her both a Christmas present and a birthday present, as well as going to her house in Fairlawn for the first time. We went to Akron's indie movie theater <i>The Nightlight</i> and saw the newest Studio Ghibli movie <i>The Boy and the Heron</i>, which we both enjoyed very much. The other half of my presents was a copy of Baldur's Gate 3 on Steam, which she still plays to this day.</p>
