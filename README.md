As a challenge to myself and as a gift to my girlfriend, I have made this webpage detailing our relationship and am making this repo for her to access whenever she wants to. 
The intent for me is to give her a constantly updating gift of some kind while also practicing and learning fundamentals of web development. Currently, as of March 2024, 
it contains only HTML5 and CSS

Clarissa, if you're the one reading this, I love you and I hope you treasure this always
